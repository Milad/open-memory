# Open Memory (PostgreSQL + MCP + Auto Embeddings + Daily Backups)

Self-hosted memory service built on PostgreSQL (`pgvector` + `pgai`), an MCP server, and a scheduled backup container.

## Why

The goal is to run one MCP memory service that all your agents and LLM-powered tools can use together.
Instead of each tool keeping isolated memory "islands", this setup provides a shared memory/context layer across clients.

It combines:

- PostgreSQL for durable shared storage
- `pgvector` + `pgai` for semantic retrieval via embeddings
- MCP as the common access protocol for different agents/services
- scheduled backups for operational safety

This is my intepretation of his idea of Open Brain. I didn't see his own implemention.

## Services

- `db`: PostgreSQL 17 (Timescale HA image with pgvector/pgai support)
- `pgai-installer`: one-shot setup that installs pgai DB objects and creates vectorizer
- `vectorizer-worker`: background worker that auto-generates/updates embeddings
- `mcp`: Postgres MCP server exposed on `http://localhost:8080`
- `pgbackups`: daily dump backups written to `./postgres/backups`
- `postgres/mcp-data`: persistent MCP files (`tokens.json`, `users.json`, conversations)

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose v2+
- `git`
- I tested this on Ubuntu only, feel free to test it if you use other systems.

Check:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Install

1. Clone and enter the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Milad/open-memory.git open-memory
cd open-memory
```

2. Create env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` with your real credentials and runtime settings.

```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

Use `.env` for both configuration and secrets in this deployment model. On live servers, keep `.env` untracked and set to `0600`.

The MCP service is pulled from GitHub Container Registry and is currently pinned in `docker-compose.yml` to:

- `ghcr.io/pgedge/postgres-mcp:1.0.0`

In the current Compose configuration, the pgEdge built-in LLM feature is disabled (`PGEDGE_LLM_ENABLED=false`). This stack exposes MCP, embeddings, and storage features, but not the pgEdge LLM/chat functionality.

Fresh installs create two database roles by default:

- `memory_admin`: owner/admin role used by PostgreSQL setup, pgai install, and the vectorizer worker
- `memory_mcp`: least-privilege role used only by the MCP server, granted access to `public.memory_nodes` and explicitly revoked from `ai`

`memory_mcp` is created during the initial PostgreSQL bootstrap from `init-db/02-mcp-role.sh`.

Important password note:

- Set `MCP_DB_PASSWORD` explicitly.
- If you test the upstream `ghcr.io/pgedge/postgres-mcp` image without this repo's wrapper, avoid shell metacharacters in the password.
- Characters such as `!`, `$`, backticks, quotes, `;`, `&`, and `|` may break the upstream container startup script.
- A conservative safe pattern for `MCP_DB_PASSWORD` is letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, and `.` only.

## Run

Start all services in background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Tail logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f db pgai-installer vectorizer-worker mcp pgbackups
```

## Automatic embeddings (pgai Vectorizer)

This stack enables automatic embedding sync for `public.memory_nodes.content`:

- `pgai-installer` runs once, executes `pgai install`, then applies `pgai-init/vectorizer.sql`
- `vectorizer-worker` continuously processes queue jobs
- new/updated rows are embedded asynchronously into `memory_nodes.embedding`

The `ai` schema remains installed for pgai/vectorizer internals, but the MCP server connects with the restricted `memory_mcp` role and is explicitly revoked from `ai`, so schema discovery stays focused on `public.memory_nodes`.

Check vectorizer status:

```bash
docker compose logs -f vectorizer-worker
```

Ready SQL checks:

```sql
-- 1) pgai installed
SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname IN ('ai', 'vector') ORDER BY extname;

-- 2) vectorizer registered
SELECT id, name FROM ai.vectorizer ORDER BY id;

-- 3) embeddings present
SELECT id, content, embedding IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding
FROM public.memory_nodes
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Run them from host shell if you want:

```bash
DBPASS="${DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-$(grep '^DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
DBUSER="${DB_ADMIN_USER:-$(grep '^DB_ADMIN_USER=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
DBNAME="${DB_NAME:-$(grep '^DB_NAME=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
docker compose exec -T -e PGPASSWORD="$DBPASS" db psql \
  -U "$DBUSER" -d "$DBNAME" \
  -c "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname IN ('ai', 'vector') ORDER BY extname;" \
  -c "SELECT id, name FROM ai.vectorizer ORDER BY id;" \
  -c "SELECT id, content, embedding IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding FROM public.memory_nodes ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

If query 3 returns zero rows, there is nothing to embed yet. Insert/update rows in `memory_nodes` and check again after a short delay.

## Use the MCP endpoint

The MCP server is exposed at:

- `http://localhost:8080/mcp/v1`

This endpoint is being used as an MCP tool server only. The staged Compose configuration disables the upstream pgEdge LLM feature, so do not expect pgEdge-hosted chat or model proxy behavior from this deployment.

Auth header format:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token-from-INIT_TOKENS-in-.env>`

### Codex MCP config example

Add/update this block in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.openmemory]
enabled = true
startup_timeout_sec = 30
command = "npx"
args = [
  "-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8080/mcp/v1",
  "--allow-http", "--transport", "http-only",
  "--header", "Authorization:${OPENMEMORY_AUTH_HEADER}",
  "--silent"
]
env = {"OPENMEMORY_AUTH_HEADER" = "Bearer <your-token>"}
```

After editing config, restart your Codex client/session.

## Make Open Memory usage automatic across agents

Connecting the MCP server is only half of the setup. If you want agents to regularly retrieve from and write to Open Memory without repeating the same prompt every time, add a persistent instruction file that tells each agent how to use memory.

Recommended shared instruction text:

```md
Use the connected Open Memory MCP server as shared long-term memory when it is relevant.

Policy:
- Before answering, retrieve relevant memory for the user, project, repo conventions, prior decisions, and ongoing work if that context would improve the answer.
- After completing meaningful work, store only durable, high-signal facts:
  - user preferences
  - project conventions
  - architectural or operational decisions
  - stable troubleshooting knowledge
  - unresolved follow-ups worth carrying forward
- Do not store secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, auth headers, `.env` contents, or raw credentials.
- Do not store transient chatter, low-value logs, or duplicate memories.
- Prefer short, factual summaries over verbose notes.
- If memory is not relevant, do not force its use.
```

Suggested pattern:

1. Save the text above in one canonical file on your machine, for example `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`.
2. Reuse it from tool-specific instruction locations with symlinks or copies.
3. Keep repo-specific overrides in repo-local instruction files when needed.

### Codex CLI and Codex for VS Code

Global instructions:

- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

Recommended setup:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents ~/.codex
ln -sf ~/.agents/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

Codex will then see the Open Memory usage policy in future chats, while the MCP server remains configured through `~/.codex/config.toml`.

For repo-specific behavior, add an `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root or a nearer subdirectory. Repo-local instructions take precedence for work in that tree.

### Claude Code

Global instructions:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Recommended setup:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
ln -sf ~/.agents/AGENTS.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Claude Code automatically loads `CLAUDE.md` memory/instruction files, so this is the simplest way to make Open Memory usage part of future Claude Code chats.

For repo-specific behavior, add `CLAUDE.md` in the project root.

Claude also needs the Open Memory MCP server configured separately. Add the MCP server in:

- `~/.claude.json`

Keep the instruction file and the MCP server configuration as two separate pieces:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` tells Claude when and how to use memory
- `~/.claude.json` tells Claude how to connect to the Open Memory MCP server

### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

Copilot does not rely on `~/.github/copilot-instructions.md` as a standard automatic discovery path by itself. To use one shared global file in VS Code, point Copilot's global custom instructions setting to your canonical file.

One workable setup is:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.github
ln -sf ~/.agents/AGENTS.md ~/.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Then in VS Code:

1. Open Copilot settings.
2. Enable custom instructions.
3. Set `Chat: Instructions Files Locations` to `~/.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

If you prefer a documented repo-based setup instead of a user-level VS Code setting, create:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repository-wide instructions
- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for path-specific instructions
- `AGENTS.md` for agent-oriented repo instructions

Use repo files when you want the behavior to travel with the repository or apply to other collaborators.

### GitHub.com Copilot Chat

GitHub.com personal instructions are configured in the GitHub UI, not by a local file path. If you use Copilot Chat on GitHub.com and want the same policy there, copy the instruction text into your personal Copilot instructions in the GitHub web interface.

### Notes

- These instruction files tell the agent when and how to use Open Memory; they do not replace the MCP server connection itself.
- Codex, Claude Code, and Copilot each have their own precedence rules between global and repo-local instruction files.
- Never place secrets in these instruction files. Keep tokens and passwords in the appropriate config or secret store only.
- If you want setup instructions for another agent, IDE, or harness, open an issue or contact us and we can document the correct integration pattern.

## Self-host behind Nginx (`/open-memory`)

If you want to expose this service at:

- `https://mcp.example.com/open-memory`

use Nginx as a reverse proxy and forward the path prefix to the local MCP service (`mcp:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080`).

Example Nginx server block:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name mcp.example.com;

    # TLS config (cert paths, ciphers, etc.) goes here

    # Redirect /open-memory -> /open-memory/
    location = /open-memory {
        return 301 /open-memory/;
    }

    # Proxy prefix path to MCP service root
    location /open-memory/ {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;

        # Strip "/open-memory/" prefix
        rewrite ^/open-memory/(.*)$ /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}
```

With this setup, your public MCP endpoint becomes:

- `https://mcp.example.com/open-memory/mcp/v1`

Codex MCP config example for reverse proxy:

```toml
[mcp_servers.openbrain]
enabled = true
startup_timeout_sec = 30
command = "npx"
args = [
  "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.example.com/open-memory/mcp/v1",
  "--transport", "http-only",
  "--header", "Authorization:${OPENBRAIN_AUTH_HEADER}",
  "--silent"
]
env = {"OPENBRAIN_AUTH_HEADER" = "Bearer <your-token>"}
```

## Backups

`pgbackups` uses:

- `SCHEDULE="@daily"`
- retention:
  - `BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS=15`
  - `BACKUP_KEEP_WEEKS=4`
  - `BACKUP_KEEP_MONTHS=6`

Backup files are stored in:

- `./postgres/backups`

## Restore from backup

1. Pick a backup file from `./postgres/backups`.
2. Restore into the running DB:

```bash
DBPASS="${DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-$(grep '^DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
DBUSER="${DB_ADMIN_USER:-$(grep '^DB_ADMIN_USER=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
DBNAME="${DB_NAME:-$(grep '^DB_NAME=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
cat ./postgres/backups/<backup-file.sql.gz> | gunzip | docker exec -i -e PGPASSWORD="$DBPASS" open-memory-db psql -U "$DBUSER" -d "$DBNAME"
```

If your dump is plain `.sql` (not gzipped), use:

```bash
DBPASS="${DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-$(grep '^DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
DBUSER="${DB_ADMIN_USER:-$(grep '^DB_ADMIN_USER=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
DBNAME="${DB_NAME:-$(grep '^DB_NAME=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)}"
cat ./postgres/backups/<backup-file.sql> | docker exec -i -e PGPASSWORD="$DBPASS" open-memory-db psql -U "$DBUSER" -d "$DBNAME"
```

## Project structure

- `docker-compose.yml`: service orchestration
- `.env.example`: required environment variables
- `init-db/01-init.sql`: DB extension/table/index bootstrap
- `pgai-init/installer.sh`: runs `pgai install` and applies vectorizer SQL
- `pgai-init/vectorizer.sql`: pgai vectorizer creation SQL
- `scripts/runtime/*.sh`: MCP/vectorizer startup wrappers
- `postgres/data/`: local PostgreSQL bind-mounted data directory
- `postgres/backups/`: local backup directory
- `postgres/mcp-data/`: persistent MCP runtime state (`tokens.json`, `users.json`, conversations)

## Common operations

Stop stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Stop and remove volumes (deletes DB data):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Recreate only MCP service:

```bash
docker compose up -d mcp
```

Re-run pgai installer (idempotent):

```bash
docker compose up --force-recreate pgai-installer
```

## Security notes

- Do not commit `.env` with real secrets.
- Treat `.env` as production-sensitive and keep it at `0600` on live servers.
- Rotate tokens/keys if they were ever exposed.
- Keep `db` unexposed to host unless you explicitly need host-side SQL access.
- Third-party license inventory: [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)
- Read [pgEdge Postgres MCP Server: Best Practices - Querying the Server](https://docs.pgedge.com/pgedge-postgres-mcp-server/guide/querying/)

## Production auth posture

Current observed state in this setup:

- `password_encryption = scram-sha-256`
- DB user password hash is SCRAM
- `pg_hba.conf` has:
  - `local all all scram-sha-256`
  - `host all all all scram-sha-256`
- `ssl = off` inside Postgres server (acceptable only if traffic stays inside a trusted private Docker network on one host, and external access is protected by HTTPS at your reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik).)

What to do for stricter policy:

1. This compose file sets strict init auth:
   `POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--auth-host=scram-sha-256 --auth-local=scram-sha-256`
2. If you cannot reinitialize, edit `pg_hba.conf` in the data directory and reload config:
   `SELECT pg_reload_conf();`

## Environment file setup

This compose stack reads credentials and tokens directly from `.env`.

- `DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL admin password
- `MCP_DB_PASSWORD`: MCP database user password
- `PGEDGE_VOYAGE_API_KEY`: Voyage API key for vectorization
- `INIT_TOKENS`: comma-separated bearer tokens for API access

Keep the real `.env` file out of version control and set it to `0600` on production systems.
